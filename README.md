# Skint

Skint is a fork of [SmallChange (SMC)] (https://github.com/bfroemel/smallchange) - a 'faster' version of Litecoin which also uses scrypt. Currently, it's nothing more than a search and replace job, that changes all mention of SmallChange to Skint for laughs. 

This is purely for research purposes and has no value (I hope) as a real magic internet money thingie.
